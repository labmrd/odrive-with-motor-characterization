This folder contains reference materials for the MRD Lab motor characterization edits made to the otherwise-intact ODrive firmware v0.5.1, including:

* **report**: Formal report of project intent, development, and results, with preliminary thoughts on use for motor control.
* **data**: Example data using motor and encoder described in report, as well as the MATLAB script used to analyze it.
* **references**: All materials cited in the report. Since these documents are primarily company-published PDFs and therefore do not have stable addresses, they have been saved here to prevent them from becoming inaccessible over time.
* **presentation**: Recorded presentation (delivered 4/30/2021) of project and instructions for use.
